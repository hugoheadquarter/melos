        <h1>Privacy Policy for Melos</h1>
        <p class="date">Last Updated: July 20, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Melos ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, Melos (the "Application"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the Application.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:</p>

        <h3>2.1. Personal Data You Provide to Us</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for an account, we collect your email address. This information is associated with your unique user ID.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication Information (Third-Party Sign-In):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you choose to log in or sign up using <strong>Google</strong>, we will receive information from Google such as your name, email address, and profile picture, as permitted by Google and your Google privacy settings. This is facilitated via an ID Token.</li>
                    <li>If you choose to log in or sign up using <strong>Apple</strong> (on iOS devices), we will receive information from Apple such as your name and email address (which may be a private relay email), as permitted by Apple and your Apple ID settings. This is facilitated via an Identity Token and a nonce for security.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> If you create playlists, we collect the playlist name and description you provide.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2. Usage Data and Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Song Interaction Data:</strong> We collect information about your interactions with songs and albums, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Songs you "like" (<code>song_likes</code>).</li>
                    <li>Your listening history, including albums played and when they were last played (<code>user_listening_history</code>).</li>

        <h1>Privacy Policy for Melos</h1>
        <p class="date">Last Updated: May 24, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Melos ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, Melos (the "Application"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the Application.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:</p>

        <h3>2.1. Personal Data You Provide to Us</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for an account, we collect your email address. This information is associated with your unique user ID.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication Information (Third-Party Sign-In):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you choose to log in or sign up using <strong>Google</strong>, we will receive information from Google such as your name, email address, and profile picture, as permitted by Google and your Google privacy settings. This is facilitated via an ID Token.</li>
                    <li>If you choose to log in or sign up using <strong>Apple</strong> (on iOS devices), we will receive information from Apple such as your name and email address (which may be a private relay email), as permitted by Apple and your Apple ID settings. This is facilitated via an Identity Token and a nonce for security.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Onboarding and Profile Information:</strong> To help personalize your experience, we may ask you for information during onboarding, such as your age range, language proficiency, learning goals, and music preferences. This information is saved to your user profile.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> If you create playlists, we collect the playlist name and description you provide.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2. Usage Data and Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Song Interaction Data:</strong> We collect information about your interactions with songs and albums, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Songs you "like" (<code>song_likes</code>).</li>
                    <li>Your listening history, including albums played and when they were last played (<code>user_listening_history</code>).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Learning Progress:</strong> We track your progress within the Application, including quiz scores (last score, highest score, total questions attempted) for songs (<code>user_song_progress</code>) and your daily activity to maintain your learning streak.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics and Usage Data:</strong> To understand how you interact with our Application, we use <strong>Mixpanel</strong>, a third-party analytics service. This includes tracking events such as screens viewed, buttons tapped, songs played, quiz performance, session duration, and other user interactions. Additionally, we track anonymized session counts to periodically refresh content within the app. This helps us improve app features and functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription and Purchase Information:</strong> To manage premium subscriptions, we use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> and <strong>Superwall</strong>. When you make a purchase, RevenueCat processes the transaction through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store and provides us with information about your subscription status (e.g., active, expired) and entitlement level. We do not receive or store your credit card information.</li>
            <li><strong>Push Notification Data:</strong> To send you push notifications, we use <strong>OneSignal</strong>. This requires us to collect a push notification token for your device. We may also associate this token with your user account and certain usage data (such as your current streak length) to send you relevant reminders and updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Device and Connection Information:</strong> Like most mobile applications, we may collect standard device information (such as device type, operating system version) and network information (such as IP address, network status) automatically through our backend provider (Supabase) and for the proper functioning of the Application.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.3. Information from Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We use Supabase as our backend service provider, which handles authentication, database storage, and file storage. Supabase may collect information as described in their privacy policy when you use our Application.</p>
